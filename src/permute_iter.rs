//! Combining ATCI and permute() to create efficient permutations
use crate::arbitrary_tandem_control_iter::ArbitraryTandemControlIterator;
use crate::permutations::permute;

/// Produce an iterator over iterators, each one of which yields one permutation of the
/// provided slice. No copying of elements of the slice occurs.
///
/// # Complexity
///
/// This function is `O(n!)` in both space and time, though with a lower constant than
/// `permute` for collections with large elements, since it does not copy elements of the
/// give slice, only indices.
///
/// # Determinism
///
/// The order of the permutations is deterministic and can be found ahead of time by
/// consulting the OEIS sequence for reverse colexicographic ordering, using
/// the appropriate elements of [A280318](https://oeis.org/A280318) as indices into
/// [A055089](https://oeis.org/A055089).
///
/// # Example
///
/// For instance, printing all the permutations of the sequence
/// `["red", "green", "blue"]`:
/// ```
/// # use permute::permutations_of;
/// for permutation in permutations_of(&["red", "green", "blue"]) {
///     for element in permutation {
///         print!("{}, ", element);
///     }
///     println!("");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Based on the ordering provided by Heap's algorithm, it's guaranteed that this
/// program will produce:
///
/// ```text
/// red, green, blue,
/// green, red, blue,
/// blue, red, green,
/// red, blue, green,
/// green, blue, red,
/// blue, green, red,
/// ```
